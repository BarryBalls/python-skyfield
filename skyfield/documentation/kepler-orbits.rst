 Kepler Orbits
===============

Skyfield now offers basic support for computing the position
of a comet or minor planet
whose elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit
is provided as Kepler orbital elements.

Beware that the internal routines supporting Kepler orbits
are rudimentary and subject to change â€”
only the interface documented here
is guaranteed to work in future Skyfield versions.

Comets
======

The Minor Planet Center distributes a ``CometEls.txt`` file
of orbital elements for predicting comet positions.
